  "readme": "# Animated\n\nDeclarative Animations Library for React and React Native\n\nSee the [interactive docs](http://animatedjs.github.io/interactive-docs/).\n\n\n## Goal\n\nThe goal of this repo is to provide an implementation of the Animated library\nthat is currently provided by React Native that can also be used by React in\na web context. At some point, React Native will itself depend on this library.\n\nAdditionally, it would be ideal if this library would be compatible with future\npotential \"targets\" of React where animation makes sense.\n\n\n## Usage (Still Theoretical)\n\nRight now the main export of this library is essentially just what is in the\n`Animated` namespace in React Native, minus the `View`, `Image`, and `Text`\nnamespace. Additionally, it includes an `inject` namespace (explained below).\n\nIdeally, I'd like to make it so that `View`, `Image`, and `Text` are exported,\nand just do the \"right thing\" depending on whether or not they are being used\nin the context of React Native or React Web.  I'm not quite sure how we can do\nthis yet without declaring dependencies on react native. Perhaps the platform\nspecific file extensions can be used for this?\n\n\n### Injectables\n\nThere are several parts of this library that need to have slightly different\nimplementations for react-dom than for react-native. At the moment, I've just\nmade these things \"injectable\" so that this library can stay dependent on only\nreact.\n\nSome of these I am implementing as \"injectable\", even though right now it would\ntechnically work for both platforms. This doesn't hurt anything, and attempts to\nmake this library more compatible with future \"targets\" for react.\n\nThe injectable modules are available off of the `Animated.inject` namespace,\nand include:\n\n- `ApplyAnimatedValues`\n- `FlattenStyle`\n- `InteractionManager`\n- `RequestAnimationFrame`\n- `CancelAnimationFrame`\n\nEach of these modules can be injected by passing in the implementation. For\nexample, a naive `FlattenStyle` could be passed in as:\n\n```js\nAnimated.inject.FlattenStyle(\n  styles => Array.isArray(styles)\n    ? Object.assign.apply(null, styles)\n    : styles\n);\n```\n",

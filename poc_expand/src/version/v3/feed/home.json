I would like to tell you the story of my awakening to reality, in the hope that it will confirm your own experiences and give you strength on the path.   <\/p>  <p> Depending on your frame of reference, you might wonder what I mean by \u201cawakening to reality\u201d. In short, I mean the awakening from the belief in a material world objectively out there to the reality of a world existing in consciousness and made out of consciousness.   <\/p>  <p> My journey started long ago, one day when I was sitting in a big conference hall in Stockholm, watching Deepak Chopra speak. I had read his book Perfect Health which had ignited my passion for Ayurveda and was excited about hearing what he had to say. But my mind was busy wondering if my baby boy was all right with his first ever babysitter, and even if I\u2019m sure that the talk was interesting, I have no recollection of what Dr. Chopra was saying.   <\/p>  <p> What I do remember cleary is the moment when I realized that there was a bright light around Dr. Chopra\u2019s body, which was obviously not caused by a spotlight. I was very close, so I could see him perfectly well. My attention focused and... my eyes widened as I saw how his body image started to shift, appearing as other persons, both male and female. A body image appeared, lingered for a while and then faded away, being replaced by a different image\/person. I spent the rest of the lecture staring at this incredible show of shifting images, at all those people who showed up before my eyes, moving and talking with Dr. Chopra\u2019s voice. All of them felt familiar, like someone you have known well but haven\u2019t seen or thought of in a very long time.   <\/p>  <p> I\u2019d like to also tell you that I had no knowledge and no belief system whatsoever that could help explain what I had just seen. In the lunch break, I hardly dared ask my husband and our friends if they had seen anything odd. My husband said he thought he saw a white shimmer around Dr. Chopra, but that was all, and I left it at that. I was shocked but not afraid, instead I felt unexplainably uplifted.   <\/p>  <p> We headed for one of the many lunch restaurants around the venue and as soon as we entered, I saw that Dr. Chopra was sitting there. Coincidence? I suddenly knew that I had to connect with him, but had no idea what I would even say. My mind was completely empty. I sat through lunch getting more and more restless, knowing that I had to do something, but not daring to move. We all finished lunch at the same time and I watched with sadness as he was heading out with his company. I said silently in my mind \u201cCould you please come to me instead?\u201d. At that precise moment, Dr. Chopra stopped, looked my way and changed direction. He headed straight to me and when he was in front of me, I managed to reach out and shake his hand, saying \u201cthank you\u201d. He looked surprised, as if he had met someone familiar but whom he couldn\u2019t place.  <\/p>  <p> This was the first experience that shifted my mind out of the ordinary. As this was before the internet and search engines, I could not go home and look for answers, so a huge question mark about the meaning of all this remained inside. Experiences that were out of the ordinary continued, showing me the way forward.  <\/p>  <p> \ufeffIf you\u2019d like to know how my story of awakening continued, here is   <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.jiyo.com\/article\/the-story-of-my-awakening-part-2-meditation\">Part 2 <\/a> .

Does my definition of  <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Living-Intent-Somewhat-Journey-Purpose\/dp\/0804139873\/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1428369718&sr=1-1\"> <b> <i>Living with Intent <\/i> <\/b> <\/a> make any sense?\u00a0  <\/p>  <p> We still meditated.

The police officers who were ensuring people could express their frustration in safe place. \u00a0  The healers and the incredible teachers who open up hearts. The mothers, fathers and grandparents who are nurturing our most precious children to love and connect and create goodness and healing for our planet.   <\/p>  <p> Martin Luther King said:  <\/p>  <p>  <i>I prayed a prayer and I prayed out loud that night.

Here Are 3 Things To Avoid!","description":"<div>  <p> Being new to a relationship can be an amazing feeling. The rush, the joy, and the occasional whoop to the sky. To keep a relationship happy, as it is from the very beginning, is easy. A number of happy couples would tell you to keep the romance aflame by taking her\/him out on dates, travel around the world and engage in fun activities. However, not many would tell you the significant things to avoid in a relationship that   <i> could   <\/i> make it a sour experience. Many relationships have fallen apart due to few tiny, albeit silly mistakes which can be avoided. Here are a few.  <\/p>  <h3> Unzip It  <\/h3>  <p> Many people fearing an argument keep things that bother them to themselves. What they don\u2019t realise is that this grows into something poisonous that eventually makes a mess. Basically, it means if you have a problem with anything that she\/he does, let them know right away, with reasons and what can be done about it. Bottling up will make you crankier and burst out for all the wrong reasons. It\u2019s convenient (and lazy) to stay mum but the truth will keep the ride smoother.  <\/p>  <h3> Your Choices Are Not Theirs  <\/h3>  <p> Keep in mind that your spouse or your girlfriend\/boyfriend or even your friend are people with their own tastes and choices. Taking decisions for them is quite disrespectful. You can give your opinions on the choices offered to them but taking a call on their behalf is a serious no-no. Respect their decisions and they will love it.  <\/p>  <h3> It\u2019s a Fresh Start  <\/h3>  <p> Don\u2019t allow the bad experiences in your past steer you for this ride. Remember this is a new person who has different views from your ex(es). Refrain from comparing and do your best to respect everything about the relationship. For example: A previous cheating experience might end up making you vary of his\/her whereabouts, ultimately shattering the trust. This is the second worst relationship killer. Instead, open your arms and allow yourself to be in love, the right way.  <\/p>  <h3> Saving The Worst For Last: Ego  <\/h3>  <p> The worst relationship killer in history is undoubtedly, this evil attribute. Trust, respect and self-esteem are important in a relationship. It is in no way a contest. You and your significant other are two wonderful people in love, who want nothing more than to be their best selves to each other. The only way this is possible is by focusing on yourself and to be better than you. The moment you find them better, more successful and happier, you need to applaud and not envy. Envying invites ego\u2019s minions. The insecurities creep right in and destroy everything you\u2019ve built.   <\/p>      \t\t\t <\/div>","teaser_image":{"preview":"https:\/\/d2ocu1m4j8oest.cloudfront.net\/media\/d6e4a9b\/596\/008\/000\/000\/2018_02_12\/g_000000008596_000000000000622066_W_320.jpg","color":"#e2cec7","content":"https:\/\/d2ocu1m4j8oest.cloudfront.net\/media\/d6e4a9b\/596\/008\/000\/000\/2018_02_12\/g_000000008596_000000000000622066_W_1200.jpg","aspect_ratio":0.67,"media_id":622066,"audio_url":null,"player_url":null,"hls_url":null,"local_key":null,"type":"image"},"content_list":[],"author":{"id":"8596","name":"Apollo Life","image":"https:\/\/d2ocu1m4j8oest.cloudfront.net\/media\/d6e4a9b\/596\/008\/000\/000\/2016_04_13\/g_000000008596_000000000000040308_W_200.jpg","bio":"Apollo Life Jiyo is a portal that supersedes all other standalone health and wellness portals in the Indian market, promulgating 360 degrees wellness, exercise, meditation, relationships, finances and finding purpose every day.

Here\u2019s 4 Tips To Get Out!","description":"<div>  <p> Gone is the time of romantic courtship and dressing up for date nights. Now is the time of deciphering relationships over text messages and conversations ending with \u201cwe\u2019ll see where things go.\u201d So many people have defined their relationship as \u2018it\u2019s complicated\u2019 that the concept has finally earned a place in the (urban) dictionary and is being referred to as a situationship. What exactly is that you ask? A situationship is a bong between two people that lies somewhere in between the realm of a relationship and a hook up.   <\/p>  <p> While it may seem like a sign of the times, these new-age situationships can take an emotional toll on a person. If you feel like you\u2019ve gotten yourself involved in a situationship and need advice on how to get out, keep reading!   <\/p>  <p> <b>Talk It Out   <\/b> One of the biggest flaws of a situationship, is the lack of communication. To avoid from getting stuck in the rut, make sure you and your partner are talking and letting each other know how you feel. The minute the conversation about your involvement in each other\u2019s lives stops, you\u2019re in for trouble. So, keep the communication channels open and freely say what\u2019s on your mind.  <\/p>  <p> <b>Define Your Boundaries   <\/b> Once you\u2019re started expressing how you feel, it\u2019s time to set some boundaries to keep the emotions from getting away from you. In a situationship, you\u2019re not dating each other, but you\u2019re not really dating anyone else either. This can become confusing because you may not know where things are going and what the rules are. Instead of letting the thoughts run wild in your mind, try setting some boundaries so you both know exactly where you stand. Whether it\u2019s defining if you should see other people, or setting clear expectations from each other, you\u2019ll have the comfort of knowing you\u2019re not going to get stranded in a situationship.   <\/p>  <p> <b>Express Your Discomfort   <\/b> If there is something that is bothering you, speak up! In a situationship, people are emotionally attached to each other and yet are very unwilling to honestly express themselves for the fear of being judged. By not talking about something that makes you uncomfortable, you\u2019re just digging yourself further down the rabbit hole.  <\/p>  <p> <b>Take A Decision   <\/b> This one may be tough, but it\u2019s necessary \u2013 If you\u2019re not sure if you can do it anymore, get out. You may wonder if the pain of trying to get over someone is worth it, or if you would be willing to risk losing a friendship in the process. But honestly, nothing should have the power to possibly damage your self-esteem and state of mind. So, if you still feel uncomfortable after opening up and setting boundaries, just take the decision to put yourself first and find a way to move on.   <\/p>  <p> To some, it may be a thrilling experience, but not everyone is cut out for a modern-day love story that\u2019s nothing more than an undefined relationship. If not cut short, it may keep going on and on like a Netflix binge marathon \u2013 and we all know how time consuming and destructive that can be!   <\/p>      \t\t\t <\/div>","teaser_image":{"preview":"https:\/\/d2ocu1m4j8oest.cloudfront.net\/media\/d6e4a9b\/596\/008\/000\/000\/2018_01_02\/g_000000008596_000000000000595050_W_320.jpg","color":"#c1bed2","content":"https:\/\/d2ocu1m4j8oest.cloudfront.net\/media\/d6e4a9b\/596\/008\/000\/000\/2018_01_02\/g_000000008596_000000000000595050_W_1200.jpg","aspect_ratio":0.67,"media_id":595050,"audio_url":null,"player_url":null,"hls_url":null,"local_key":null,"type":"image"},"content_list":[],"author":{"id":"8596","name":"Apollo Life","image":"https:\/\/d2ocu1m4j8oest.cloudfront.net\/media\/d6e4a9b\/596\/008\/000\/000\/2016_04_13\/g_000000008596_000000000000040308_W_200.jpg","bio":"Apollo Life Jiyo is a portal that supersedes all other standalone health and wellness portals in the Indian market, promulgating 360 degrees wellness, exercise, meditation, relationships, finances and finding purpose every day.

It\u2019s never easy to get back up after a such a blow and that\u2019s just the toned down version of how it feels when you lose a loved one. Be it your spouse, your parents or your pet. Be it a breakup, a divorce or death. The pain of losing is real and the suffering is harsh. There is a sense that you can\u2019t even recognize the world anymore, yet life moves on oblivious to your pain. After such an upheaval, how does one come to terms with the loss and move ahead in life? You might find these steps useful in your journey.   <\/p>  <p> <b>Facing Reality   <\/b> The pain can consume you, but when you\u2019re ready to confront it don\u2019t put it off. Denying and avoiding can eat you up from within, so much so that your normal functions begin to falter. The fact that you can never meet the person again is necessary to acknowledge, an important step towards healing. You will notice that this is actually liberating and you would no longer be carrying the baggage of the past.  <\/p>  <p> <b>Acknowledge your feelings   <\/b> Bottling up your emotions is no solution. The pain of loss is indescribable and very few have managed to emulate them in words, even then our suffering and our means to cope can be so individual and unique. The sadness of their absence, the anger at them for leaving you, the confusion of how to move forward without them and the shattered feeling of loneliness. Acknowledge them and work through them. A good way to do this is writing down the feelings that you are going through, even the act of committing these thoughts to paper can prove to be very therapeutic.   <\/p>  <p> <b>Don\u2019t scratch the wound   <\/b> Your mind begins to make things worse by crafting thoughts like \u201cIt\u2019s your fault\u201d, \u201cEverybody leaves you\u201d, or \u201cYou were mean to them at so and so time\u201d.

It can make you strong and change your perspective for the better. Wisdom and strength improves for the better. The significance of our short life is a lot clearer and that\u2019s all the motivation you\u2019d need to be a kind, ambitious human.  <\/p>  <p> A loss of a loved one is inevitable.

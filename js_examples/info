Function declaration/statement(FD) verses Function Expression (FE)
    - FD been declared before any statement is created but after statement body is invoked
    - FE calls function object is created when it gets executed.

    - Hoisting - which gets supported in FD and moves to top of the code
    - In FE, will throw error if the function obj called before the declaration.

    - FE advantage is that they are IIFE, can be used as closures and can be used as arguments to the other functions
